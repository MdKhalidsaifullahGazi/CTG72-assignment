		<MARK>The <b>sea</b> was like a rippling blanket of brochure-blue.</MARK> Squabbling seagulls flew overhead, harassing the beachgoers in their endless hunger. Gannets were dive-bombing the stretched surface of the <b>sea</b> far out from shore. The horizon was edged with a silver tint and a cormorant was flying into that place where sun and water meet. His wings were a blur of motion and he soon faded from sight.</p>

<p>The opera of the <b>sea</b> washed over me and the wave-music was welcome. <i><u>It was soothing and I was glad to get away from the hurly-burly and stresses of life.</u></i> <br><sub>Davy Jones</sub>> locker had swallowed up many a man over the centuries, but the beach I walked on was an enchanting paradise.

Their bodies flashed in steel-grey and I could almost touch their glee. It was a skin-tingling experience to witness their <STRONG>sea dance</STRONG> </p>
